## Project Summary

This project addresses the challenge of predicting 30-day hospital readmissions for diabetes patientsâ€”a high-risk populationâ€”by developing a hybrid CNN-LSTM model that captures both spatial and temporal patterns from Electronic Health Records.
> **Disclaimer**: The dataset used is HIPAA-compliant and cannot be shared. This project is for academic and demonstration purposes only.

- Dataset: 261,000 HIPAA-compliant inpatient encounters
- Goal: Forecast 30-day readmission from past patient visits
- Method: Deep Learning with CNN-LSTM (1D conv + LSTM layers)
- Result: **AUROC = 0.96**, outperforming all baseline models
